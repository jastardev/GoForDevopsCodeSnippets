# GoForDevOps Code Snippets
This Repo contains code snippets from as I followed along with the book "Go for DevOps" by John Doak and David Justice. 

Some of the code is my own that I used to better understand the concepts in the book and some of the code is directly copied from the book, but with fixes for typos and bugs. 

Feel free to use this code as you learn, but do give credit to John Doak and David Justice, as well as Packt Publishing.
